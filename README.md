# Joon's Portfolio

Hi!, thanks for visiting here. This is my third side project which is my portfolio web-application built with React and deployed on Netlify.
I've focused on Intuitive and user-friendly UI design, improving performance of SPA, implementing front-end unit tests, managing global states with Context API.

## How to explore

Go to <a href="https://joondev.me">htps://joondev.me</a>

## Technical skills

<i>React, Typescript, Tailwind.css, Vite, Jest</i>

## Features

1. **UI design**: Structured React.js to showcase each section at an optimal eye level, enhancing the user experience by ensuring content is immediately
   visible, intuitive, and easy to grasp, thus enhancing the overall quality of the SPA development."
2. **Performance**:Delve deeper into React hooks: useRef, useMemo, and custom hooks to grasp their individual use cases and how they contribute to
   enhancing application performance. Gain an understanding of when and how to utilize them to optimize applications.
3. **Golbal state management**: Implemented a Context API architecture for managing global states with an understanding of the hierarchy of contextProvider, re-
   rendering policies, advantages, caveats and differences with Redux.
4. **Unit tests**: Thrive Unit tests such as routing tests, snapshot tests, UI tests with Jest and react-testing-library.

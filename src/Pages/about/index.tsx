          Hi! I'm <b>Joon</b>, based in Melbourne, and have been self-studying
          Web Development since early 2023. <br /> <br />
          As a web developer, I enjoy â€” combining my technical knowledge with my
          keen eye for details to create a solid functioning Website. <br />
          My goal is to always build applications that are <b>
            scalable
          </b> and <b>efficient</b> under the hood while providing engaging,
          pixel-perfect user experiences. <br />
          Currently, my focus lives on <b>Front-End</b>, which I find incredibly
          fulfilling. <br /> <br />
          <b>When I'm not in front of the computer screen</b>, I'm probably
          fishing, jogging, singing or crossing off another item on my bucket
          list.

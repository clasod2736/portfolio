        Hi! I'm <b>Joon</b>, based in Melbourne and have been self-studying Web
        Development since early 2023. <br /> <br />
        As a web developer, I enjoy â€” combining my technical knowledge with my
        keen eye for details to create a solid functioning Website. <br />
        My goal is to always build applications that are <b>
          scalable
        </b> and <b>efficient</b> under the hood while providing engaging,
        pixel-perfect user experiences. <br />
        Currently, my focus lives on <b>Front-End</b>, which I find incredibly
        fulfilling. <br /> <br />
        <b>When I'm not in front of the computer screen</b>, I'm probably
        fishing, jogging, singing or crossing off another item on my bucket
        list.
